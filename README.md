# Timezones

Why did I create this? At the time of writing, I'm working in a TypeScript project that needs a list of timezones derived from the IANA timezone database, but the `moment-timezone` library isn't working as expected.

To run this: `node index.js` and you'll see the output in `./timezones.json`
